# Casper

***Warning: Casper is currently in development.***

Casper is an interchain options exchange protocol built on the Juno Network. With Casper, a option provider can create, list and sell option contracts while an option buyer can buy option contracts with underlying assets from dozens of IBC enabled chains.

Lightly inspired by Dopex, Casper allows the creation of Option Pools of call and put options. Then providers can create and list there option contracts in an Option Pool where users can purchase that contract. All option contracts require a lock-up of the underlying asset keeping Casper trustless. Providers, earn via a contract premium payed on the underlying option contract. If the premium price is 0.50 CASP and the underlying contract supplies 50 tokens of ATOM, then the contract price is 25 CASP.
